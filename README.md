## Assessment of the fatigue strength using local stresses
The assessment of the fatigue strength is carried out using local elastic stresses. the assessment applies uniformly to all types of components.

### Characteristic service stress
1. Stress spectrum and constant amplitude S-N curve

    ```
    sigma_ai -> stress amplitude in step i
    sigma_mi -> mean stress in step i
    ```
2. Adaptation of a stress spectrum to matach the component constant amplitude S-N surve
    ```
    Conversion to a stress ratio R=-1
    Conversion to another stress ratio R
    ```

3. Damage-equivalent stress amplitude
    ```
    assess process: cycle number -> stress amplitude?  not sure, need confirm
    ```
